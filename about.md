title: About me 
---

I'm currently a student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research interests are **Computer Vision**, **Object Detection and Segmentation**, **Multiple Objects Tracking** and **Event Detection**.

I'm also crazy about *FingerStyle* and a big fan of **GOGO Satoshi** and his music.
